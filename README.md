# 201808_DemandForecasting

This is an individual project regarding prediction of sales demand in retail business. I applied exploratory data analysis, built timeseries model and generated sales forcast for next three months in 10 different stores. The challenge which I delt with was publicly open in Kaggle as ‘Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge’.
